# Introduction to Computer Systems

## Lab-related

I'm working for labs of this lecture, especially datalab (the first one), on **macOS**. And I cannot use the lab tools properly. So I plan to use docker for lab environment. However, because I use docker little on macOS, I found I cannot get `docker0` interface (detailed on [there-is-no-docker0-bridge-on-the-host](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/networking/#there-is-no-docker0-bridge-on-the-host)), which means I cannot use ssh to connect the lab environment. (It's also ok if I just use linux in docker to compile something, but I want to build a general image for others who want to finish these labs on macOS.)

I'll figure it out as soon as I can.
