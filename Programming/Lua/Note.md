# Lua

Because I want to use [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/), which use Lua as the script language, I'm going to study basic Lua for it, with this note.

## Install

### macOS

Just install via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install lua
```

## Hello World

Besides traditional `hello world`, this part also includes some basic programming syntax, e.g., working flow control. The corresponding file is [hello_world.lua](./scripts/hello_world.lua)

```lua
print("Hello World!")
```
