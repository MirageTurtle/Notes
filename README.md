# Notes

This is my notes for studying something. I'm not sure what this *something* is. I just found that I have a bad habit of learning something halfway, and I wish I could break it by this repo. Maybe I'll study something by the format of a project. I think this is very effective, and [taoky](https://github.com/taoky) also suggests this way.

I may fill this repo in Chinese on the way of my study in future. If I have enough time, I will consider provide an English version.

Wish me luck!
